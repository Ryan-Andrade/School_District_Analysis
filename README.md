# School_District_Analysis
An analysis of standardized test data to provide insights about performance trends. I aggregated the data in order to assist the school board with budget prioritizing. Data has been treated with confidentiality in compliance with all FERPA laws. The software's used are Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, and Python 3.7. 

## How is the district summary affected?
  The district summary's values were changed by a very small amount. removing the 9th graders from Thomas high school only chaged their scores by tenths of a percent. 
  
## How is the school summary affected?

And here are the scores now:https://postimg.cc/PLqWSstn

As you can see the scores have barely changed.

## How does replacing the ninth-graders affect the following:
 # Math and scores by grade
The ninth grader scores were all replaced by NaN. The remaining scores remained the same. 
 
 #Scores by school size
 The scores were barely affected
 
 #Scores by school type
 The scores were affected by a few hundreths of a percent.
 
 #Summary
 Four changes were 1 the scores were replaced with NaN. 2. The Thomas High school scores were changed by a few hundredths of a percent. 3. The overall result was changed by very little. 4. The summary pretty much remained the same.
